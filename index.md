I am a mathematician working at the intersection of IT security, privacy and machine learning at the [St. PÃ¶lten University of Applied Sciences](http://fhstp.ac.at/). I recently finished my doctorate in set theory at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/) in October 2018, where I have worked mostly on cardinal characteristics of the continuum.

I live in Vienna and on the internet. My pronouns are he/him/his.
